# Intro
Welcome to ACME Corp!
We're so happy you could start a week early!
We just got approval on our hiring spend, but didn't want to 
start bothering people on LinkedIn until you made some platform
decisions to help us with our search.

Can you get these back to us by the end of the day?

I know this is your first Lead role since being a senior engineer, 
but we're sure you're going to nail it!

Besides, everyone else who applied for the position wanted 
double what you were asking, so it's win-win, right?

# Email Reply
Hey thanks for getting back to us so quickly!
I pushed out a job req. for another Lead to help you, one for a 
VP and a desktop support technician.

Wasn't sure what you meant about "CI/CD" so I just wrote down
what we used at my last place: Team Foundation Server - same thing,
right?

# The New VP
The new VP has negotiated a fantastic deal with Oracle Cloud!
Based on our current runway, they'd like you to switch from
$CLOUD to Oracle Cloud by next week. 

Don't worry about other deliverables, saving money is the most
important thing right now. Anyway, should just be a couple of 
days work - they're just clouds, right?
