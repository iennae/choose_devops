# Choose Your Own DevOps
A menu-driven game that walks you through a form setting up some infrastructure
decisions based on previous answers.  

## Pre-Requisites
The only thing you will need is a form of `dialog` installed. For example, the 
shell version on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install -y dialog
```

> Note: Dialog is typically installed by default, though `xdialog`, `kdialog` and `gdialog` are also options.
